# Change Log
All notable changes to the HANcoder project will be documented in this file

## Version 0.4
- Changed from Sourcery Codebench lite to the GNU ARM Embedded Toolchain
- Added support for Matlab 2014b, 2015a, 2015b, 2016a & 2016b
- Added Analog Ouputs (D10 and D13)
- Changed naming of the output pins: only the connector name is used (PG - 3 = pin 3 on connector PG)
- UDP blocks have been added
- CANopen Node blocks are added but not extensively tested
- CANopen Client blocks have been deleted because of several issues with the blocks
- RAM blocks have been removed, it is better to use the Simulink Data Store blocks
- Java is no longer required. (ASAP2 post processing is now done in Matlab)
- An auto flash function is added that allows the user to automatically start MiroBoot after a succesful build
- A function is added which automatically adds signals and parameters for HANtune
- The A2L file is now placed in the same directory as the model
- The timing of the E407 is fixed. (It is no longer off by 4%)
- The CAN receive blocks now output the last received values when no new message was received.

Warning:
- Due to a change in structure all HANcoder blocks in older models must be replaced!

## Version 0.5
- Changed template makefile to accept non-8dot3 names (short names like C:/Progra~1)
- Increased size of additional stack in the Base Sample Time blocks
