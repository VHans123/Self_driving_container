<font color="#000099" size="+3">UDP Server Receive</font><br>
<p>Block to read data from the UDP server's internal receive buffer.</p>


<p><font color="#000099" size="+1"><b>Description</b></font></p>
<p>With this block you can access the data of the data packet that was most
recently received by the UDP server.
</p>


<p><font color="#000099" size="+1"><b>Remarks</b></font></p>
<ul>
    <li>Make sure the model contains an 'Ethernet Config' block, as this enables the TCP/IP stack that the UDP blocks depend on.
    <li>Make sure the model contains an 'UDP Server Init' block, as this block requires the UDP server functionality.
</ul>


<font color="#000099" size="+1"><b>Output</b></font><br>
<p><b>Data (port 1-32)</b><br>
The output type depends on the configuration.<br>
The amount of outputs depends on the configuration.
</p>


<font color="#000099" size="+1"><b>Parameters</b></font><br>
<dl>
<dt><b>Output ports</b>
    <dd>Number of output ports for this block.

<br><br>
<dt><b>Output datatype</b>
    <dd>Select the data type each output port will use.

<br><br>
<dt><b>Byte ordering</b>
    <dd>Set the appropriate byte ordering for your CAN message:
	<dd>Checkbox checked = Most Significant Bit (MSB) is send first (Motorola format).
	<dd>Checkbox unchecked = Least Significant Bit (LSB) is send first (Intel format).

<br><br>
<dt><b>Start index</b>
    <dd>The UDP server's receive buffer can be seen as an array of bytes. This parameter
        enables you to select the index of the byte where the read operation will start at.

<br><br>
<dt><b>Sample time</b>
    <dd>Sample time of the block. The Sample time (in seconds) defines
        the rate at which the block is visited by the real-time scheduler of
        the target. The value of the Sample time has to be an integer multiple
        of the base sample time of the model.
