<p>Block to control a CAN open node</p>
<hr>
<p><font color="#000099" size="+1"><b>Description</b></font></p>

<p>This CAN open node control block sends the message to set the node
in the specified state. This state can be selected in the mask. 
After the state request is send the block sends a RTR message to check if the 
node is in the set state. When this is the case the done output will become 1.<br>
</b></p>
<hr>

<p><font color="#000099" size="+1"><b>Remarks</b></font></p>

<ul>
    <li>Always use a CAN open node control block at the beginning to set the node to pre-operational.
    <li>When the node isn't in the right state after this message is send, done will become -1.
</ul>
<hr>

<font color="#000099" size="+1"><b>Declaration</b></font><br>

<p>Use the CAN config block:</p>
<ul>
    <li>To set the baudrate for the selected CAN channel.
    <li>To enable the specific CAN channel.
</ul>
<hr>

<font color="#000099" size="+1"><b>Input</b></font><br>

<p>
<dt><b>start (port 1)</b><br>
<dd>When the start input is 1, the message is send and the block waits the waiting time for a 
<dd>response to check if the node is in the right state. 
<dd>When start is made 0 again, done becomes 0 too. 
<dd>After start has been 0 and it is made 1 the message will be send again, and the block will 
<dd>again wait for acknowledge. <b>INT8</b><br>
</p>
<hr>

<font color="#000099" size="+1"><b>Output</b></font><br>

<dl>
<dt><b>Node ID (port1)</b>
    <dd>The node ID selected in the mask is put on this output, this output should be the input 
	<dd>for the SDO write and read blocks.<b>UINT8</b>
	
<dt><b>Done (port2)</b>
    <dd>The done port becomes 1 when the acknowledge message is received. 
	<dd>When the waiting time is passed and no acknowledge message is received done will 
	<dd>become -1. <b>INT8</b>
	
<dt><b>State (port3)</b>
    <dd>The state response from the controller is put on this output.<b>UINT8</b>
	<li> 4 = 0x04 Stopped 
	<li> 5 = 0x05 Operational 
	<li>127 = 0x7F Pre-Operational 
</dl>

<font color="#000099" size="+1"><b>Parameters</b></font><br>

<dl>
<dt><b>CAN channel</b>
    <dd>Select the used channel: 1, 2, 3 or 4.
<dt><b>Node ID</b>
    <dd>The CAN open node ID, can be a number between 1 and 0x3F. 
	<dd>Be aware when ID of 0 is chosen, this means all the messages send with this ID are for all 
	<dd>the CAN open nodes on the bus (advise to never use this).
	
<dt><b>Go to state</b>
    <dd>Select the state to go to.<br>
	<li>Pre-operational: all settings can be set in this state, no PDO messages will be send right now.
	<li>Operational: the node is started now, many settings are locked in this state and PDO messages will be send.
	<li>Stop: the node is stopped, no communication is possible only state messages will be received by the CAN open node.
	<li>Reset: the node is completely reset and behaves like it is rebooted the node automatically goes into pre-operational state.
	<li>Reset Communication: is a reset of the communication functions. Objects 0x1000 - 0x1FFF are reset to their power-on defaults. <br>

<dt><b>Response waiting time</b>
    <dd>The maximum time the block has to wait for a acknowledge response in milliseconds.	

<dt><b>Sample time</b>
    <dd>Sample time of the block. The Sample time (in seconds) defines
        the rate at which the block is visited by the real-time scheduler of
        the target. The value of the Sample time has to be an integer multiple
        of the base sample time of the model.
