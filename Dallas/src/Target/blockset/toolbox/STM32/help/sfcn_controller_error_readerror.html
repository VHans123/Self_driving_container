<font color="#000099" size="+3">Read an error stored on the RAM or EEPROM of the controller</font><br>
<p>Block to read an error stored on the RAM or EEPROM of the controller, active errors are read from RAM, stored from EEPROM</p>

<p><font color="#000099" size="+1"><b>Description</b></font></p>

<p>The block receives an error number (starting at 1) and returns the number of active errors and the requested error data.</p>

<p><font color="#000099" size="+1"><b>Remarks</b></font></p>

<ul>
    <li>Error number 1 is the oldest error.
    <li>Connect the 'number of errors' to a terminator if not used.    
    <li>Active errors are saved in RAM, they are lost by rebooting the ECU or by clearing the active error list.
    <li>Stored errors are saved in EEPROM, they are only lost by clearing the stored error list.
    <li>For active errors the occurence counter is incremented every time a error occurs. 
    It is reseted by rebooting the ECU or by clearing the active error list.
    <li>For stored errors the occurence counter is always 1. It is reset by clearing the stored error list.
    <li>Error codes 0 to 0x8000 are reserved for internal system errors.
</ul>

<font color="#000099" size="+1"><b>Declaration</b></font><br>

<p>(No initialisation block needed)</p>

<font color="#000099" size="+1"><b>Input</b></font><br>

<p>An uint8 containing the number of the error in the error list. Can be between 1 and 64.</p>

<font color="#000099" size="+1"><b>Output</b></font><br>

<p>The four error values along with the total amount of errors is returned.
<dl>
<dt><b>Output 1</b>
  <dd>The first output returns the number of total number of active or stored errors. This will 
  be returned as an uint8.
<dt><b>Output 2</b>
  <dd>The second output returns the error code (ID) of the requested error. This will 
  be returned as an uint16.
<dt><b>Output 3</b>
  <dd>The third output returns the given parameter of the error. This 
  will be returned as a unit8.<br><br> 
  The parameter can be used for the severity of the error. Suggested values are:<br>
  10 = minor<br>
  15 = standby<br>
  20 = critical
<dt><b>Output 4</b>
  <dd>The fourth output returns the number of times the requested error has occurred (see remarks).
  This will be returned as an uint8. If this value is 0, then the requested error was not set.
<dt><b>Output 5</b>
  <dd>The fifth output returns the timestamp of the requested error. The timestamp is in milliseconds after system 
  startup. This will be returned as an uint32.
