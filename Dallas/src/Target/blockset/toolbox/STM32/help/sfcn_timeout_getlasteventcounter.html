<font color="#000099" size="+3">Get Last Event Counter</font><br>
<p>Reads the time stamp of the last output compare event.</p>

<p><font color="#000099" size="+1"><b>Description</b></font></p>

<p>
Each time an output compare event occurred on a timer channel, the value of the timer module's
internal 16-bit free running counter is saved. This block gives you access to this timestamp
value of the free running counter.
As an example this is useful to create an exact square wave.
For this each wave transistion need to be scheduled as an output compare event and the next
event time can be derived from the last event counter.
</p>


<font color="#000099" size="+1"><b>Output</b></font><br>

<p>16-bit free running counter timestamp of the last output compare event.<br>
The used datatype is of uint16.

<font color="#000099" size="+1"><b>Parameters</b></font><br>

<dl>
<dt><b>Timer Output Pin</b>
<dd>Selects the timer channel.

<dt><b>Sample time</b>
  <dd>Sample time of the block. The Sample time (in seconds) defines
the rate at which the block is visited by the real-time scheduler of
the target. The value of the Sample time has to be an integer multiple
of the base sample time of the model.
