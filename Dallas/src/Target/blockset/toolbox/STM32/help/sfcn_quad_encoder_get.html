<font color="#000099" size="+3">Quadrature Encoder Get</font><br>
<p>Reads the Quadrature encoder counter value.</p>

<p><font color="#000099" size="+1"><b>Description</b></font></p>

<p>
When using this block, the channel A and channel B signals of the quadrate encoder should
be connected to the channel 1 and channel 2 pins respectively of the timer module that
was selected in the block parameters.
</p>

<p>
The underlying software driver processes the channel A and channel B signals to create a
32-bit signed counter as can be seen in the illustration below. <i>TI1</i> is the quadrature
encoder's channel A, <i>TI2</i> is channel B, and <i>Counter</i> is the value returned by this block.<br>

</p>

<p>
The counter value that is outputted by this block is of datatype int32, so its range is from –2,147,483,648 
to 2,147,483,647. The counter will underflow/overflow if it gets out of range. To prevent the counter
from going out of range you can manually reset the counter back to 0 through the block's boolean input.
This input can be enabled through the checkbox 'Show counter reset input'. If a rising edge is detected 
on the block input, the counter will be reset to 0.

<font color="#000099" size="+1"><b>Output</b></font><br>

<p>Counter value<br>
The used datatype is of int32.

<dl>
<dt><b>Quadrature Encode Module</b>
<dd>Selects the Timer to use as the quadrature encoder module.

<br><br>

<dt><b>Configuration</b>
<dd>Select if the inputs are floating or internally connected to a pull-up or pull-down resistor.


<br><br>

<dt><b>Show counter reset input</b>
<dd>Configures if the input port for the counter reset should be shown.

<br><br>

<dt><b>Sample time</b>
  <dd>Sample time of the block. The Sample time (in seconds) defines
the rate at which the block is visited by the real-time scheduler of
the target. The value of the Sample time has to be an integer multiple
of the base sample time of the model.
