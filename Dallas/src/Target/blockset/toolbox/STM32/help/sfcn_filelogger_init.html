<p>Block to initialize the File Logger module</p>

<p><font color="#000099" size="+1"><b>Description</b></font></p>

<p>The 'File Logger Init' block instructs the code generator to enable support for the 
File Logger module. This module allows the logging of Simulink signals (at a fixed
time interval) into a file that is written to the SD-card.
</p>
<p>All signals in the ASCII log-file are separated by a semicolon. This data format allows the 
log-files to be opened by any tool that can read CSV files, such as Microsoft Excel.
</p>

<p><font color="#000099" size="+1"><b>Remarks</b></font></p>

<ul>
    <li>Place the FAT32 formatted SD-card into the slot on the system before starting the software program.
    <li>The File Logger Close block must be present and called explicitly to stop logging, otherwise no
    file will be written to the SD-card. Ideally, this block is called during software shutdown for example
    when the ignition signal goes low in automotive applications. An external trigger can also be used such
    as a button press event or CAN message reception.
</ul>

<font color="#000099" size="+1"><b>Parameters</b></font><br>

<dl>
<dt><b>Filename</b>
    <dd>Name of the log-file, including file extension. It will be written to the root directory on the SD-card.
<dt><b>Add auto-incrementing number to filename</b>
    <dd>If enabled, then a 3-digit sequence number will be added to the log-file and automatically increment it
        between software program starts. So if the filename is specified as 'mylog.txt', then the first time the
        software program is started, the log-file will be called 'mylog001.txt', the next time the software program
        is started, it will be called 'mylog002.txt', etc.
<dt><b>First line in log-file</b>
    <dd>Specify the first line for the log-file. Typically, this line contains the column headers for the logged
        data signals. Note that the File Logger module automatically adds the timestamp in the first column. The
        next columns contain the data signals.
<dt><b>Logging interval (ms)</b>
    <dd>This detemins the delta time as which the data signals are sampled and written to the log-file. Specify
    the time in milliseconds. Note that a short logging interval will increase the CPU load. It is recommended
    to specify a value >= 5ms.
<dt><b>Maximum signals to log</b>
    <dd>Specify the maximum number of signals you intend to log. This determines the number of columns in the log-file
    in addition to the timestamp column.
<dt><b>Use dot-character as decimal seperator (comma otherwise)</b>
    <dd>After sampling data signals, the signal valus are converted to a string in order to be able to write them to
    the log-file. This configurable instructs the File Logger module to use either a '.'-character or ','-character
    as a decimal separator.
<dt><b>Automatically start logging</b>
    <dd>Select if logging should automatically start after initialization. If not then a trigger input will appear 
    that can be used to trigger the logging start.
</dl>




<p><font color="#000099" size="+1"><b>Examples</b></font></p>

<p>
Given is the following configuration:
<dl>
<dt>Filename: 'mylog.txt'
<dt>Add auto-incrementing number to filename: Yes
<dt>First line in log-file: 'time;counter1;counter2'
<dt>Logging interval (ms): 100
<dt>Maximum signals to log: 2
<dt>Use dot-character as decimal seperator (comma otherwise): No
</dl>
</p>
<p>
After running the software program, the log-file 'mylog001.txt' will appear on the SD-card with the following contents:
</p>
<pre>
time;counter1;counter2
0,100;1;100
0,200;2;101
0,300;3;102
0,400;4;103
0,500;5;104
0,600;6;105
0,700;7;106
0,800;8;107
0,900;9;108
1,000;10;109
1,100;11;110
....etc....
</pre>
