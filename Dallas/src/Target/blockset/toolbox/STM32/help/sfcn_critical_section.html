<p>This document explains the use of critical sections in a Simulink model that makes use of the HANcoder environment.</p>

<p><font color="#000099" size="+1"><b>Description</b></font></p>

<p>Critical sections are needed whenever a piece of software needs to execute without being interrupted. They are typically
used to guarantee data consistency. The HANcoder environment contains 2 blocks to creating critical sections: "Enter Critical
Section" and "Enter Critical Section". These blocks must always be used as a pair. So for every "Enter Critical Section" block
in your Simulink model, you must also add a "Exit Critical Section" block.
</p>
<p>
Critical section are only needed when signal values are shared between the model (that executes at a fixed time interval) and
a function-call subsystem connected to an interrupt source (that executes at interrupt level). This could be the case when you
have the "Timer Input IRQ" block in your model.
</p>
<p>
The topic of critical sections is best explained with an example. Let's assume you have 2 input signals that belong together: (1) 
"event_info" and (2) "event_timestamp". Furthermore, these 2 signals are inputs to a function-call subsystem that executes at
interrupt level. See the following illustration:

<p>
The model in the above illustration has a data consistency problem. During software execution there is a small chance that the timer
interrupt occurs after the "event_info" signal was written, but right before the write to "event_timestamp". In the function-call subsystem
the "event_info" signal is up-to-date but the "event_timestamp" signal not yet. A critical section is needed to solve this data consistency 
problem. This is best achieved with a stateflow chart:

<p>
As a result of the critical section, the write to the 2 signals "event_info_out" and "event_timestamp_out" can not be interrupted. When 
these 2 signals are now used as the inputs to the function-call subsystem that executes at interrupt level, there are no more data consistency
problems.
