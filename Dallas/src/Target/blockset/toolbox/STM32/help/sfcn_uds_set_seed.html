<p>Block to set the 32-bit seed value to be used in the seed/key unlock sequence.</p>

<p><font color="#000099" size="+1"><b>Description</b></font></p>

<p>During a UDS seed/key sequence, a UDS tester first requests a seed from the ECU. The UDS tester typically uses 
this seed to compute a 32-bit key, which it then sends back to the ECU to unlock a resource, such as memory access.</p>

<p>The 'UDS Set Seed' block sets this 32-bit seed value that is sent back to the ECU tester upon request. This block
is typically used in the function-call subsystem connected to the output of the 'UDS Get Seed Event' block. This
subsystem is triggered when the UDS tester requested a seed.</p>

<font color="#000099" size="+1"><b>Parameters</b></font><br>
<dl>
<dt><b>Sample time</b>
  <dd>Sample time of the block. The Sample time (in seconds) defines
      the rate at which the block is visited by the real-time scheduler of
      the target. The value of the Sample time has to be an integer multiple
      of the base sample time of the model. Set it to -1 (inherited) when used
      inside a function-call subsystem.
</dl>

<font color="#000099" size="+1"><b>Inputs</b></font><br>
<dl>
<dt><b>Seed</b>
  <dd>32-bit value of the seed that the UDS tester could use in the key computation algorithm.
</dl>
