<font color="#000099" size="+3">UDS Get Seed</font><br>
<p>Block to read the 32-bit seed that was previously set with the 'UDS Set Seed' block.</p>

<p><font color="#000099" size="+1"><b>Description</b></font></p>

<p>The 'UDS Get Seed' block reads the 32-bit seed that was previously set with the 'UDS Set Seed' block. In the seed/key
sequence to unlock a resource, the key is typically derived from the seed using an application specific computation.
In this case, the 'UDS Get Seed' is typically used in the function-call subsystem connected to the output of the
'UDS Verify Key Event' block to verify that the key, received from the UDS tester, is actually valid.</p>

<font color="#000099" size="+1"><b>Parameters</b></font><br>
<dl>
<dt><b>Sample time</b>
  <dd>Sample time of the block. The Sample time (in seconds) defines
      the rate at which the block is visited by the real-time scheduler of
      the target. The value of the Sample time has to be an integer multiple
      of the base sample time of the model. Set it to -1 (inherited) when used
      inside a function-call subsystem.
</dl>

<font color="#000099" size="+1"><b>Outputs</b></font><br>
<dl>
<dt><b>Seed</b>
  <dd>32-bit value of the seed that was previously set with the 'UDS Set Seed' block.
