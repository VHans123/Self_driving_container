<p>Allows a function call subsystem to be connected to its output that gets executed each time and edge change on the 
input pin was detected.</p>

<p><font color="#000099" size="+1"><b>Description</b></font></p>

<p>
Enables a function call subsystem to be connected that is executed on interrupt level each time an edge change
on the input pin was detected. Because the code inside the connected subsystem is executed at interrupt level, it
should be as short as possible to not negatively influence the interrupt latency time.

<dl>
<dt><b>Timer input pin</b>
<dd>Selects the timer input pin. Note that the timer module this pin belongs to is specified as well.
When a timer module is used for timer input measurements, it can not be used for other timer related
functionality such as quadrature encoder inputs, PWM outputs, etc.
