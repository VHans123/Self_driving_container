<p>Block with a function-call output that gets triggered during a seed/key sequence, when the UDS tester
requested a seed.</p>

<p><font color="#000099" size="+1"><b>Description</b></font></p>

<p>This block has a function-call output that gets triggered during a seed/key sequence, when the UDS tester
requested a seed. The connected subsystem should contain a 'UDS Set Seed' block to give the seed back to the 
UDS tester.</p>

<p>A 'UDS Get Seed Event' block is needed when the parameter 'UDS seed/key' required is set to TRUE (checked)
in the 'UDS Init' block.</p>

<p>The value of the seed is application specific. It can be as simple as a constant value or something more 
dynamic such as the value of the timer system's free running counter. The following illustration shows how this
block is used to give a seed value of 0xaa5500ff.</p>

<p>Note that the sample time parameter of the constant block with the seed value should be set to '-1' (inherited) 
and not 'inf', otherwise the subsystem is optimized out during code generation.</p>
