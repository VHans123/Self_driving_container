<font color="#000099" size="+3">CAN config</font><br>
<p>Block to configure a CAN channel</p>

<p><font color="#000099" size="+1"><b>Description</b></font></p>

<p>The 'CAN Config' block instructs the code generator to include CAN support.
The block also configures the CAN controller communication speed and the reception
acceptance filter.</p>

<p><font color="#000099" size="+1"><b>Remarks</b></font></p>

<ul>
    <li>When not using the CAN config block, support for the given CAN
    channel is not included in the embedded target. Thereby every CAN
    message adressed at the controller is lost.
    <li>The default configuration of the reception acceptance filter 
    received all 11-bit CAN message identifiers. 
</ul>

<font color="#000099" size="+1"><b>Parameters</b></font><br>

<dl>
<dt><b>CAN channel</b>
    <dd>Enable CAN channel(s).
<dt><b>Baudrate</b>
    <dd>125000, 250000, 500000 or 1000000.
<dt><b>Mask</b>
    <dd>A value in the range 0x00000000 and 0x1fffffff. The mask part of the filter determines which 
        bits in the received message identifiers should be matched to the corresponding bits in the code part.
        A mask bit value of 0 means don't care.
<dt><b>Code</b>
    <dd>A value in the range 0x00000000 and 0x1fffffff. The code part of the filter determines what bit 
        values to match in the received message identifier.
<dt><b>Mode</b>
    <dd>Mode of the reception acceptance filter where you can configure what type of CAN message identifiers
    should be received.
<dt><b>Transmit buffer size</b>
    <dd>The number of software transmit buffers in addition to the 3 internal hardware buffers of the CAN controlller.
        4 are sufficient at 500 kbits/sec, but more might be needed at lower baudrates because message transmission
        takes longer, resulting in the 3 internal hardware buffers of the CAN controller to be occupied longer.
<dt><b>Event buffer size</b>
    <dd>The number of software event buffers to events such as message reception and message transmission completion.
        8 are sufficient at 500 kbits/sec at 100% busload. More might be needed at higher baudrates because more messages
        will be received at a similar busload.
</dl>

<p><font color="#000099" size="+1"><b>Examples</b></font></p>

<p>
For run-time performance it is recommended to finetune the reception acceptance filter so that
primarily messages that are needed by the software application are received. Otherwise unwanted 
messages will still be processed by the CAN driver, which is a waste of CPU power. Here you can find
a few examples:
</p>
<p>
Example 1 - receive all 11-bit and 29-bit message identifiers.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Filter = %X XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Mask = 0x00000000<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Code = 0x00000000 (irrelevant in this case)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Mode = Receive both 11- and 29-bit message identifers<br>
<br>
Example 2 - receive only 11-bit message identifiers where bits 0..3 are 0.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Filter = %X XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX 0000<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Mask = 0x0000000f<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Code = 0x00000000<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Mode = Receive only 11-bit message identifiers<br>
<br>
Example 3 - receive only the 29-bit message with identifier 0x0000400e<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Filter = %0 0000 0000 0000 0100 0000 0000 1110<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Mask = 0x1fffffff<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Code = 0x0000400e<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Mode = Receive only 29-bit message identifiers<br>
