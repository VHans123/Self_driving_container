<font color="#000099" size="+3">Search an error stored in RAM or EEPROM of the controller</font><br>
<p>Block to search an error stored on the RAM or EEPROM of the controller, based on error code and error parameter.</p>

<p><font color="#000099" size="+1"><b>Description</b></font></p>

<p>The block receives the error code and parameter, returning (if available) the found error data.</p>

<p><font color="#000099" size="+1"><b>Remarks</b></font></p>

<ul>
    <li>Active errors are saved at the RAM, they are lost by rebooting the ECU or by clearing the active error list.
    <li>Stored errors are saved at the EEPROM, they are only lost by clearing the stored error list.
    <li>For active errors the occurence counter is incremented every time a error occurs. 
    It is reseted by rebooting the ECU or by clearing the active error list.
    <li>For stored errors the occurence counter is always 1.
    <li>The combination of the error code and parameter makes an unique error.
    <li>Error codes 0 to 0x8000 are reserved for internal system errors.
</ul>

<font color="#000099" size="+1"><b>Declaration</b></font><br>

<p>(No initialisation block needed)</p>

<font color="#000099" size="+1"><b>Input</b></font><br>

<dl>
<dt><b>Input 1</b>
  <dd>An uint16, containing the error code of the requested error.
<dt><b>Input 2</b>
  <dd>An uint8, either being the error paramter or array number.
</dl>
</p>

<font color="#000099" size="+1"><b>Output</b></font><br>

<p>Two values will be returned.
<dl>
<dt><b>Output 1</b>
  <dd>The first output returns the number of times the requested error has occurred (see also remarks).
  This will be returned as an uint8.
<dt><b>Output 2</b>
  <dd>The second output returns the timestamp of the requested error. The timestamp is in milliseconds,
  starting at the start of the operating time counter. This will be returned as an uint32.
</dl>
</p>

<font color="#000099" size="+1"><b>Parameters</b></font><br>

<dl>
<dt><b>Sample time</b>
  <dd>Sample time of the block. The Sample time (in seconds) defines
the rate at which the block is visited by the real-time scheduler of
the target. The value of the Sample time has to be an integer multiple
of the base sample time of the model.
</dl>
