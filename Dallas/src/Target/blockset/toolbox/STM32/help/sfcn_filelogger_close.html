<p>Block to close the log-file of the File Logger module</p>

<p><font color="#000099" size="+1"><b>Description</b></font></p>

<p>With the File Logger module active, the data values of the configured signals 
are sampled at a fixed time interval and written to the log-file on the SD-card.
</p>
<p>The log-file needs to be explicitly closed at the end of a logging session for the
log-file to actually appear on the SD-card.
</p>
<p>Ideally, this block is called during software shutdown for example when the ignition
signal goes low in automotive applications. An external trigger can also be used such
as a button press event or CAN message reception.
