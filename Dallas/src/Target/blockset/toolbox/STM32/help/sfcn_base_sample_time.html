<font color="#000099" size="+3">Base Sample Time config</font><br>
<p>Block to set the base sample time that should be used within that program.</p>

<p><font color="#000099" size="+1"><b>Description</b></font></p>

<p> This block gives you the opportunity to adjust the base sample time of the
program. The smallest supported base sample time is 0.1ms (10 kHz), however this
can be made even smaller by reconfiguring the run-time library as explained below.
The entered value depends on how many times per second the user want to base sample 
time through the complete model.</p>

<p><font color="#000099" size="+1"><b>Remarks</b></font></p>

<ul>
	<li>This block should always be used once in every model.
	<li>Upon code generation, the fixed-step size of the model under:
	Simulation -> Configuration Parameters -> Solver -> Fixed-step size
  is automatically adjusted.
	<li>The default base sample time is set to 10ms (100Hz)
</ul>

<p>(No initialisation block needed)</p>

<font color="#000099" size="+1"><b>Parameters</b></font><br>

<dl>
<dt><b>Sample time</b>
  <dd>Sample time of the block. The Sample time (in seconds) defines
the rate at which the block is visited by the real-time scheduler of
the target. The value of the Sample time has to be an integer multiple
of the base sample time of the model.
<br><br>
<dt><b>Extra stack</b>
    <dd>It is possible to reserve extra stack space for the OS task that executes
        the model on the embedded target (AppCtrlTask). A Simulink model with more
        signals will result in more local variables in the generated code for the 
        model's step function, using up more stack space. Note that the block 
        "Get free Stack" can be used to monitor the stack usage.
</dl>

<p><font color="#000099" size="+1"><b>Reconfiguring the run-time library</b></font></p>
<p>
The default smallest supported sample time is determined by the tick time of the
operating sytem. This can be re-configured through macro configTICK_RATE_HZ in
the FreeRTOSConfig.h header-file of the target. Note that changing this macro
requires a rebuild of the run-time library. This is achieved by deleting the run-time
library file (*.a) of the target and starting the code generation process in
Simulink.
