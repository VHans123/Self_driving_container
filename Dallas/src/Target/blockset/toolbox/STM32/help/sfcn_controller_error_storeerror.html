<font color="#000099" size="+3">Store error</font><br>
<p>Block to store an error to RAM (and EEPROM) of the Controller</p>

<p><font color="#000099" size="+1"><b>Description</b></font></p>

<p>When this block is triggerd, an error wil be stored to RAM. If the error is already present in RAM, its occurrence counter will be incremented 
and the time stamp will be updated.<br><br>
If the error occurs for the first time (and only then) since startup (and therefor is not present in the RAM) it will also be stored in EEPROM.
</p>

<p><font color="#000099" size="+1"><b>Remarks</b></font></p>

<ul>  
    <li>Active errors are saved at the RAM, they are lost by rebooting the ECU or by clearing the active error list.
    <li>Stored errors are saved at the EEPROM, they are only lost by clearing the stored error list.
    <li>For active errors the occurence counter is incremented every time an error occurs. It resets if the error is erased.
    again as the ECU was rebooted and the error occures again. It resets if the error is erased.
    <li>The input of the 'Store error with inports' block must be variable in order for the block to work.
    <li>Use the 'Store errors' block when using fixed error values.
    <li>Error codes 0 to 0x8000 are reserved for internal system errors.
</ul>

<font color="#000099" size="+1"><b>Declaration</b></font><br>

<p>(No initialisation block needed)</p>

<font color="#000099" size="+1"><b>Input</b></font><br>

<p>Only the 'Store errors with inports' has inputs, when used provide an uint16 containing the error code (ID) and an uint8 for the parameter.</p>

<font color="#000099" size="+1"><b>Parameters</b></font><br>

<p>Only the 'Store errors' block has parameters.</p>
<dl>
<dt><b>Error Code</b>
  <dd>An 16-bit error code can be used. Use 'hex2dec()' 
  to transform a hexadecimal formatted ID into a decimal ID.
<dt><b>Parameter</b>
  <dd>A parameter can be given. The parameter can be used for
  the severity of the error. Suggested values are:<br>
  10 = minor<br>
  15 = standby<br>
  20 = critical
</dl>
