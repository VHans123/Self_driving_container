<p>Block with a function-call output that gets triggered during a seed/key sequence, when the UDS tester
sent a key that needs to be verified.</p>

<p><font color="#000099" size="+1"><b>Description</b></font></p>

<p>This block has a function-call output that gets triggered during a seed/key sequence, when the ECU 
received a 32-bit key from the UDS tester that needs to be verified. The connected subsystem should contain
a 'UDS Set Key Verified' block to inform the UDS module if the received key was correct, allowing it to
unlock the resource, such as memory access.</p>

<p>A 'UDS Verify Key Event' block is needed when the parameter 'UDS seed/key' required is set to TRUE (checked)
in the 'UDS Init' block.</p>

<p>The accepted key value is application specific. It can be as simple as a constant value or an algorithm that
derives the key from the seed. The following illustration shows how this block is used. It implements an algorithm
that only accepts the key if its value equals the seed + 1.</p>

<p>Note that the sample time parameter of the constant block with value '1' should be set to '-1' (inherited) 
and not 'inf', otherwise the subsystem might be optimized out during code generation.</p>
