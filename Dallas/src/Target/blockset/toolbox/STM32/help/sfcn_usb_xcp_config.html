<p>Block to use and configure the XCP over USB protocol</p>

<p><font color="#000099" size="+1"><b>Description</b></font></p>

<p>A 'XCP Config' block instructs the code generator to include the XCP
over USB protocol.
</p>
<p>A USB communication stack is automatically included that makes the controller 
show up as a virtual COM port on the PC. Use the Windows Device Manager to determine
the COM port number. Configure 115200 bits/sec as the communication speed on the PC side.</p>

<p><font color="#000099" size="+1"><b>Remarks</b></font></p>

<ul>
    <li>Make sure to install the USB Virtual COM-port driver connecting the controller
    with your PC using a USB cable. The USB driver is located at 
    .\Installs\Drivers\VirtualCOMport. VCP_V1.3.1_Setup.exe is for 32-bit operating systems
    and VCP_V1.3.1_Setup_x64.exe for 64-bit operating systems.</li>
    <li>Only one instance of the XCP protocol is currently allowed on the
    controller.</li>
