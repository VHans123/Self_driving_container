<p>Reads an analog input pin.</p>

<p><font color="#000099" size="+1"><b>Description</b></font></p>

<p>A 'Analog Input' block reads the 12-bit analog to digital conversion results of the selected pin.</p>

<font color="#000099" size="+1"><b>Output</b></font><br>

<p>12-bit conversion results value (0-4095)<br>
The used datatype is uint16.

<dl>
<dt><b>Input pin</b>
<dd>Selects the analog input pin.
<dt><b>Use oversampling and filter (E407 and P405 only)</b>
<dd>When this option is turned on the ADC will sample 10x faster than the base sample time and
the results are filtered with a median/average filter. Note that this can cause a phase shift.
The filtering takes quite some CPU time and therefore it is recommended to use this only when 
really necessary.

<dt><b>Sample time</b>
  <dd>Sample time of the block. The Sample time (in seconds) defines
the rate at which the block is visited by the real-time scheduler of
the target. The value of the Sample time has to be an integer multiple
of the base sample time of the model.
