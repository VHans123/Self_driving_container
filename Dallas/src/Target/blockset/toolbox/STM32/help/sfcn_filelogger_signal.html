<font color="#000099" size="+3">File Logger Signal</font><br>
<p>Block to configure the signal to be logged by the File Logger module.</p>

<p><font color="#000099" size="+1"><b>Description</b></font></p>

<p>The 'File Logger Signal' block configures the input signal of the block to be logged by the File Logger 
Module. This means that the value of the input signal will be sampled by the File Logger Module
and written to the log-file on the SD-card.
</p>

<p><font color="#000099" size="+1"><b>Remarks</b></font></p>

<ul>
    <li>The File Logger Close block must be present and called explicitly to stop logging, otherwise no
    file will be written to the SD-card. Ideally, this block is called during software shutdown for example
    when the ignition signal goes low in automotive applications. An external trigger can also be used such
    as a button press event or CAN message reception.
</ul>

<font color="#000099" size="+1"><b>Parameters</b></font><br>

<dl>
<dt><b>Signal Index</b>
    <dd>This is a zero-based index that basically specifies in what column this signal will appear in the
    actual log-file. In the File Logger Init block a maximum number of signals was specified, lets call it
    'max_signals'. This parameter can have a value of 0..(max_signals-1). The first column in the log-file
    is always the timestamp. If the Signal Index is 0, then the block's input signal value will be logged
    into the column next to the timestamp, column 2. If the Signal Index is 1 then its value will be logged
    into column 3, etc.
<dt><b>Data Type</b>
    <dd>Specify the data type of the blocks input signal.
