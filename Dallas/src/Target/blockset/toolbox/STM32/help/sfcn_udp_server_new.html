<font color="#000099" size="+3">UDP Server New Data Available</font><br>
<p>Block to check if the UDP server has new data in its internal receive buffer.</p>


<p><font color="#000099" size="+1"><b>Description</b></font></p>
<p>This block obtains the value of the so called new data flag. By checking this flag, the application
can determine if there is data available in the UDP server receive buffer that has not been read out
yet.</p>
<p>This new data flag is set each time the UDP server receives a data packet, right after it wrote the data 
to its internal receive buffer. The new data flag is reset when the application reads data from the UDP
server's internal receive buffer, by means of block 'UDP Server Receive'.</p>


<p><font color="#000099" size="+1"><b>Remarks</b></font></p>
<ul>
    <li>Make sure the model contains an 'Ethernet Config' block, as this enables the TCP/IP stack that the UDP blocks depend on.
    <li>Make sure the model contains an 'UDP Server Init' block, as this block requires the UDP server functionality.
</ul>


<font color="#000099" size="+1"><b>Output</b></font><br>
<p>1 if new data is available in the UDP server's receive buffer that hasn't been read yet by the application, 0 otherwise.<br>
The used datatype is of boolean.
</p>


<font color="#000099" size="+1"><b>Parameters</b></font><br>
<dl>
<dt><b>Sample time</b>
  <dd>Sample time of the block. The Sample time (in seconds) defines
the rate at which the block is visited by the real-time scheduler of
the target. The value of the Sample time has to be an integer multiple
of the base sample time of the model.
