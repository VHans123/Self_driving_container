    <dd>Select the UART channel
<dt><b>Use status output</b>
    <dd>Enables/disables the status output port of the block.
<dt><b>Sample time</b>
  <dd>Sample time of the block. The Sample time (in seconds) defines
the rate at which the block is visited by the real-time scheduler of
the target. The value of the Sample time has to be an integer multiple
of the base sample time of the model.
</dl>

<font color="#000099" size="+1"><b>Output1</b></font><br>

<p>This output holds the value of the byte that was read from the reception buffer.<br>
The used datatype is 8-bit unsigned.
</p>

<font color="#000099" size="+1"><b>Output2</b></font><br>

<p>If this output has a value of 0, no byte was read from the reception buffer because it was empty.<br>
