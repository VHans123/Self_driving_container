<p>Allows a function call subsystem to be connected that is executed on interrupt

<p><font color="#000099" size="+1"><b>Description</b></font></p>

<p>
Enables a function call subsystem to be connected that is executed on interrupt
level each time an output compare event was triggered. Because the code inside the 
connected subsystem is executed at interrupt level, it should be as short as possible 
to not negatively influence the interrupt latency time.

<dl>
<dt><b>Timer output pin</b>
<dd>Selects the timer channel and its associated input pin. Note that the timer module this pin belongs to is
specified as well. When a timer module is used for timer output compare functionality, it can not be used for 
other timer related functionality such as quadrature encoder inputs, PWM outputs, etc.
