<p><font color="#000099" size="+1"><b>Description auto add</b></font></p>

<p>The option to automatically add parameters and signals runs a script which searches for constants<br>
and signals with names which have not been defined in the workspace. When it finds a constantblock it<br>
will check if the value is defined in the workspace and if not it will add this value as a Simulink.Parameter.<br>
It will also set its storage class to 'ExportedGlobal', this will ensure it will end up in the ASAP2(.A2L) file.<br>
All parameters in the ASAP2 file will be editable in HANtune. Because each constant will need a value before<br>
the model can be build, you will be prompted for a value. (press cancel to abort the build)<br>
All signals in the model that have a valid Matlab name will automatically be added to the workspace as<br>
Simulink.Signal with its storage class set to 'ExportedGlobal'. These signals will become visible in HANtune.</p>

<p><font color="#000099" size="+1"><b>Description auto flash</b></font></p>

<p>The option to automatically start flashing after the build procedure calls MicroBoot with the interface<br>
that was selected in the block. It will flash the .srec that was just built from the model.<br>
Note: MicroBoot.exe must be located in ..\Host\MicroBoot\ relative to the blockset path (the path where the<br>
model is located)</p>
