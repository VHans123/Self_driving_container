<font color="#000099" size="+3">UDP Server Receive Size</font><br>
<p>Block to obtain the number of bytes currently stored in the UDP server's receive buffer.</p>

<p><font color="#000099" size="+1"><b>Description</b></font></p>
<p>Each time the UDP server receives a new data packet, it stores the data in its internal receive buffer.
Note that the previously received data packet is overwritten. This block reads the size in bytes of the
most recently received data packet. To access the data, the block 'UDP Server Receive' can be used.
</p>

<p><font color="#000099" size="+1"><b>Remarks</b></font></p>
<ul>
    <li>Make sure the model contains an 'Ethernet Config' block, as this enables the TCP/IP stack that the UDP blocks depend on.
    <li>Make sure the model contains an 'UDP Server Init' block, as this block requires the UDP server functionality.
</ul>

<font color="#000099" size="+1"><b>Output</b></font><br>
<p>Number of bytes of the most recently received data packet that is currently stored in the UDP server's 
receive buffer.<br>
The used datatype is of uint16.
</p>


<font color="#000099" size="+1"><b>Parameters</b></font><br>
<dl>
<dt><b>Sample time</b>
  <dd>Sample time of the block. The Sample time (in seconds) defines
the rate at which the block is visited by the real-time scheduler of
the target. The value of the Sample time has to be an integer multiple
of the base sample time of the model.
