<p>Block to read the free Heap size.</p>

<p><font color="#000099" size="+1"><b>Description</b></font></p>

<p>A 'Get free Heap' block reads the number of bytes that are still available on the heap.
</p><p>The heap is a part of RAM that is used for dynamic memory allocation. For example, each 
CAN receive block allocates some heap memory for storing the message related data.</p>


<font color="#000099" size="+1"><b>Output</b></font><br>
<p>Number of bytes still available on the heap in bytes.</p>

<font color="#000099" size="+1"><b>Remarks</b></font><br>
<p>The heap size can be changed by editing the macro configTOTAL_HEAP_SIZE in file FreeRTOSConfig.h. 
Note that the runtime library needs to be rebuild after changing this macro. Rebuilding is only
possible if you have access to all the C source and header files. If this is the case, simply 
delete the *.a library file for the target in question. The library files are located in the 
'.\Target\blockset\rtw\c\HANcoder_Target\STM32\lib\' directory. Once deleted, simply start the
build procedure from the Simulink model as usual and because the *.a library file is missing,
it will automatically be rebuild.</p>
