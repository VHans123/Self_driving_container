# Self_driving_container

This is the repository of the self driving container chassis called Dolly.

It is split up in three main parts.

1 The first one is called Drawings. In this part you can find all the SolidWorks drawings of the chassis.

2 The second one is called Electronics. In this part you can find the Schematic design and PCB design of the PCB. These files are made in Multisim and Ultiboard.

3 The third one is called Software. In this part you can find all the Matlab and Simulink files. These files are used to receive data from the XBee. Also these files contain the software for controlling the wheel speed and angle.

The steering angle and speed of the Dolly is given by the Jetson. This Jetson uses a vision system. Because the vision system and the Dolly are two different parts, each one has it's one GitHub repositoy. Below you can find a link to the repository of the Jetson.
